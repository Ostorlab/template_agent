# OXO Template Agent

This repo is a template for building an [OXO](https://github.com/ostorlab/ostorlab) agent in Python. It ships with
Good best practices like:

* Github actions workflow
* Linting checks with Ruff
* Static typing checks with Mypy
* Running the unit test with Pytest

## Getting Started

## Ideas for Agents to build

Implementation of popular tools like:

* ~~[semgrep](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep) for source code scanning.~~
* [nbtscan](http://www.unixwiz.net/tools/nbtscan.html): Scans for open NETBIOS nameservers on your targetâ€™s network.
* [onesixtyone](https://github.com/trailofbits/onesixtyone): Fast scanner to find publicly exposed SNMP services.
* [Retire.js](http://retirejs.github.io/retire.js/): Scanner detecting the use of JavaScript libraries with known
  vulnerabilities.
* [snallygaster](https://github.com/hannob/snallygaster): Finds file leaks and other security problems on HTTP servers.
* [testssl.sh](https://testssl.sh/): Identify various TLS/SSL weaknesses, including Heartbleed, CRIME and ROBOT.
* ~~[TruffleHog](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/truffleHog): Searches through git repositories for high entropy
  strings and secrets, digging deep into commit history.~~
